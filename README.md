MonReader: Page Flip Detection with CNN
Image Classification using Deep Learning | 92% Accuracy | F1 Score: 93%

ðŸš€ Overview
This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a page is being flipped or not, using single image frames from smartphone videos.
The model is part of the MonReader ecosystem â€” a mobile-based, AI-powered document digitization tool designed for blind users, researchers, and bulk document scanning.

ðŸ§  Objective
Predict whether a page is being flipped using a single image frame.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Collected from smartphone videos labeled as flipping and not flipping

ðŸ›  Tools & Tech

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Jupyter Notebook
